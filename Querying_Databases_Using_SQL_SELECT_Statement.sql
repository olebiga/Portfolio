##########################################################
##########################################################


#############################
-- Task One: Introduction
-- In this task, retrieve data from the four tables in the database
#############################

-- Retrieve all data from the employees table
SELECT * FROM employees;



-- Retrieve all data from the departments table
SELECT * from departments


-- Retrieve all data from the departments employees table
Select * from dept_emp



-- Retrieve all data from the salaries table

SELECT * FROM salaries

#############################
-- Task Two: SELECT - FROM AND WHERE
-- In this task, you will retrieve data from tables as in task one. In addition, 
-- you will learn how to set conditions on the result set of a query using the WHERE clause
#############################

##########
-- SELECT - FROM

-- 2.1: Select the first name and last name of all employees
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM employees

-- 2.2 Select all records from the employees table
SELECT * FROM employees;

-- 2.3 (Ex.) Select the department number from the departments table
SELECT dept_no FROM departments

-- 2.4 (Ex.) Select all records from the departments table
SELECT * FROM departments;

############
-- SELECT FROM - WHERE

-- 2.5 Select all employees whose first name is 'Elvis'
SELECT * from employees WHERE first_name='Elvis'
    
-- 2.6 (Ex.) Select all employees whose first name is 'Hilari'
SELECT * from employees WHERE first_name='Hilari'

#############################
-- Task Three: SQL Operators
-- In this task, you will retrieve data from tables in the employees database,
-- using different SQL operators together with the WHERE clause
#############################


###########
-- AND

-- 3.1 Select all male employees whose first name is 'Denis'
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE gender='M' AND first_name='Denis'
  
-- 3.2 (Ex.) Select all female employees whose last name is 'Reistad'
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE gender='F' AND last_name='Reistad'

###########
-- OR

-- Recall we have done this in 3.1 above  

SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE first_name = 'Denis' AND gender = 'M';

-- 3.3 Select all employees whose first name is 'Denis' or 'Elvis'
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE first_name='Denis' OR first_name='Elvis'


-- Let us compare with this
-- Select all employees whose first name is 'Denis' and 'Elvis'

SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE first_name = 'Denis' AND first_name = 'Elvis';
    
-- 3.4 (Ex.) Retrieve a list of all employees whose first name is either
'Kellie' or 'Aruna'
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE first_name='Kellie' OR first_name='Aruna'


###########
-- Operator Precedence

-- 3.5 Retrieve a list of all male or female employees whose last name 
---is 'Denis'

SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE last_name = 'Denis' AND gender = 'M' OR gender = 'F';

-- Correct Syntax
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE 
last_name = 'Denis' AND (gender = 'M' OR gender = 'F')

-- 3.6 (Ex.) Retrieve a list of all female employees whose first name is either
'Kellie' or 'Aruna'
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE 
gender='F' and (first_name='Kellie' or first_name='Aruna')

###########
-- IN / NOT IN

-- 3.7: Retrieve a list of all employees whose first name is either 'Cathie', 'Mark'
---or 'Nathan'

SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE first_name = 'Cathie' OR first_name = 'Mark' OR first_name = 'Nathan';

-- Alternative Solution
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE 
first_name in ('Cathie', 'Mark', 'Nathan')
-- NOT IN
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE 
first_name not in ('Cathie', 'Mark', 'Nathan')

#############################
-- Task Four: Wildcard Characters 
-- In this task, you will retrieve data from tables in the employees database,
-- using different wildcard characters together with the WHERE clause
#############################

###########
-- LIKE / NOT LIKE 

-- 4.1: Extract a list of all employees whose first name starts with 'Mar'
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE 
first_name like 'Mar%'

-- 4.2: Extract a list of all employees whose first name starts with 'Ar'
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE 
first_name like 'Ar%'

-- 4.3: Extract a list of all employees whose first name ends with 'Ar'
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE 
first_name like '%ar'
-- 4.4: What do you think the result of this query will be?

SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE first_name LIKE('%ar%');

-- 4.5: What do you think the output will be here?

SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE first_name LIKE ('Mar_');

-- 4.6: What about this??
    
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE first_name NOT LIKE ('%Mar%');

-- 4.7 (Ex.): Extract all individuals from the 'employees' table whose first name 
-- starts with 'Mark'
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE 
first_name like 'Mark%'


    
-- 4.8 (Ex.): Extract all individuals from the employees table whose first name 
-- does not contain 'Jack'
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE 
first_name not like '%Jack%'



#############################
-- Task Five: SQL Operators - Part 2
-- In this task, you will retrieve data from tables in the employees database,
-- using different SQL operators together with the WHERE clause
#############################

###########
-- BETWEEN - AND

-- 5.1: Extract a list of all employees who were employed between
-- 1st of January, 1990 and 1st January, 2000

hire_date BETWEEN '1990-01-01' AND '2000-01-01'


    
-- 5.2: Extract a list of all employees who were not employed between
-- 1st of January, 1990 and 1st January, 2000

-- 5.3 (Ex.): Select all the records from the salaries table, regarding contracts
-- from 66000 to 70000 dollars/year

SELECT * FROM salaries;

-- Solution to 5.3

SELECT * FROM salaries WHERE 
salary BETWEEN '66000' AND '70000'

-- 5.4: Retrieve a list of individuals whose emp_no is not between
-- 10004 and 10012.

SELECT * FROM salaries WHERE 
emp_no NOT BETWEEN '10004' AND '10012'

###########
-- IS NOT NULL / IS NULL

-- 5.5: Extract a list of employees whose first name is not null
   
-- Let us count how many first names are in the employees table
SELECT COUNT(First_name) From employees
-- Solution to 5.5

#############################
-- Task Seven: Select Distinct, Order BY, Limit, and SQL Aliases.
-- In this task, you will learn how to retrieve distinct data from tables in the employees database.
-- In addition, you will learn how to sort the result set, how to limit the result set and how to
-- give a temporary name to a column of a table.
#############################

###########
-- SELECT DISTINCT

-- 7.1: Select distinct gender from the employees table

-- Let us retrieve data from the gender column from the employees table
SELECT gender
FROM employees;

SELECT *
FROM employees
ORDER BY first_name;

ORDER BY emp_no LIMIT 5;


-- From 5.5: We counted how many first names are in the employees table

SELECT COUNT(first_name)
FROM employees;

-- 7.8: How many firstname are in the employees table. Rename the result as
-- FirstName_Count

SELECT COUNT(first_name) as FirstName_Count
FROM employees;



-- Let's count how many distinct first names we have in the employees table


SELECT DISTINCT first_name, COUNT(*) as FirstName_Count
FROM employees GROUP BY first_name ORDER BY FirstName_Count DESC
